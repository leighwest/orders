# Cupcake Orders Service

This Java Spring Boot web application allows users to place orders for cupcakes using a RESTful API documented with Swagger. The client is routed to the Swagger UI by an NGINX reverse proxy.

The application uses a microservice architecture which communicates with an order distribution application using Apache Kakfa.  

The customer receives order confirmation and dispatch notification emails using Amazon's Simple Email Service (SES).

The applications and MySQL database are deployed in Docker containers to AWS EC2 instances. The AWS infrastructure is built using Terraform. Environment variables are accessed via AWS Parameter Store.

Unit and integration tests are written with the JUnit 5 framework with test code coverage reports automatically generated by JaCoCo.

## Local Development Setup

Clone the repository and create a `.env` file to store environment variables for the SMPT service. Set a `MAIL_USERNAME` variable to the email address you wish to send order emails from and `MAIL_PASSWORD` to the password for this email address.

`cd` into the root directory and run `docker-compose up`.

Open the application with an IDE (such as IntelliJ) and run `mvn install`, before running the application. The swagger URL is available at `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html`
